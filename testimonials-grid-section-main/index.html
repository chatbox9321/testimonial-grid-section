    ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
    the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

     ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
 professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
 student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
 did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
 project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
 could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
 experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
 100% recommend! ‚Äù
